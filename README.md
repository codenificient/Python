# Mapping my Python Journey

### Initial Python introductory course taken in November 2019 prior to joining a MS program

This `repository` contains various Python courses and projects I have attempted over the years after completing the [Zero to Mastery Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=ST21MT121624) on `Udemy`. I have read books, read online articles, attempted some YouTube tutorials, ebooks and a book on Machine Learning.

#### December 2024 Update

My latest Python practice is a Data Science and Machine Foundations course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/machine-learning-ai-engineering-foundations). After completing the foundations course, I intend to pursue various skill paths and career path on Codecademy aroud Cloud and Machine Learning Engineering.
