# Portfolio Project for Codecademy ML / AI Foundations course

This project highlights trends in the US Crime rate for 47 states in 1960. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilpagopal/us-crime-dataset/data). The aggregated data from the '60s allows for simple exploratory data analysis using tools such as Pandas, numpy, matplotlib and more.

An accompanying Jupyter notebook containing the code will be uploaded
